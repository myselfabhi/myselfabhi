## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Frontend / Full Stack Developer with 2+ years of professional experience**, working across **distributed teams, startups, enterprise platforms, and freelance products**.

I specialize in building **clear user flows, scalable UI systems, and maintainable frontend architectures**. I approach development with a **product mindset**, often thinking through features the way a product manager would — balancing usability, scalability, and business impact.

I’m comfortable working **asynchronously**, owning features end-to-end, and collaborating across time zones through clear communication and documentation.

Currently, I’m deepening my understanding of **backend systems, system design, and DevOps (Docker)** to build more complete, production-ready systems.
