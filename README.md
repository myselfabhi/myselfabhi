## 👨‍💻 About.

Frontend/Full Stack Developer with **2+ years of professional experience**, working across **startups, enterprise platforms, and freelance projects**.

I focus on **clean user flows, maintainable UI systems, and end-to-end feature ownership**. I approach development with a **product mindset**, often thinking through features from a user and business perspective, similar to how a product manager would.

Comfortable working in **remote, async-first environments**, collaborating across time zones through clear communication and documentation.  
Currently expanding deeper into **backend systems, system design, and DevOps (Docker)**.
